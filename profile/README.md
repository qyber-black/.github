[Qyber\black](https://qyber.black/) is a network of researchers working on topics related to quantum control. It is run and supported by its members for its members.
It is an open, free platform to support its members' research and release their results. We provide development, project management, hosting,
computing, and communication resources.

This is a mirror of most of its public reposiotires.
